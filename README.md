This is my homage to one of my favorite movies of all time: Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

When you start, it will ask you for some personal information. You may enter whatever you want!
HTML colors might come in handy (hint, hint).

Next, there are ten questions about the movie. You have a limited time to answer each question,
which is shown with an orange, diminishing progress bar. Click on the radio button next to
your answer, followed by the submit button. You will then see if you got the question right.
If you got it wrong, you will see which is the correct answer.

The number of questions you answered correctly will be displayed at the end of the quiz.
Enjoy!
